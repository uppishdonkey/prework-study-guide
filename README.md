# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a web application that I created using the lessons/guides provided by the bootcamp.
I built this  web application so I can use it to help/remind me to study various topics in the coding bootcamp.
My motivation behind this project was based on my ability to grasp the content/concepts that the bootcamp provided. I enjoyed the process of creating while learning. It really helped me to see what I was learning have a real presence. 
The problem that this web application solves is keeping relevant study topics from the bootcamp organized.
I learned about countless programs and all the ways they can be utilized as well as how a successful programmer operates. I learned about different ways of thinking that programmers utilize.
